### How to Use and Run the Project Files and Codes

To run the face detection and blur project, execute the `face_blur.py` script. This script requires the OpenCV and NumPy libraries, which can be installed using `pip install opencv-python numpy`. Ensure you have the necessary model files: `deploy.prototxt` and `res10_300x300_ssd_iter_140000_fp16.caffemodel`, which can be downloaded from the provided URLs and placed in the same directory as the script. Additionally, place the image you want to process in the same directory and name it `test_image.jpg`. Running the script will read the image, detect faces, apply Gaussian blur to the detected faces, and save the resulting image as `blurred_image.jpg`.

### Explanation of the Algorithms Used

The face detection and blur project uses a pre-trained deep learning model based on the Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) framework with a ResNet backbone, implemented using OpenCV's DNN module. The `deploy.prototxt` file defines the network architecture, while the `caffemodel` file contains the pre-trained weights. The image is first preprocessed by resizing and mean subtraction before being fed into the neural network. The model outputs bounding boxes for detected faces along with confidence scores. Faces with confidence scores above a threshold (40%) are blurred using Gaussian blur, which smooths the pixel values to create a blurring effect. The processed faces are then reinserted into the original image, preserving the background while anonymizing the detected faces. This approach effectively combines face detection and image processing to achieve the desired face blurring.
