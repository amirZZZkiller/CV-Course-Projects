### How to Use and Run the Project Files and Codes

To run the cartoonify project, you need to execute the `cartoonifier-python-project.py` script. This script requires several libraries including OpenCV, EasyGUI, NumPy, ImageIO, Matplotlib, and Pillow. Install these dependencies by running `pip install opencv-python easygui numpy imageio matplotlib pillow`. The script creates a GUI window using Tkinter, where you can upload an image file by clicking the "Cartoonify an Image" button. Once an image is selected, the script processes it and displays the original and cartoonified images side-by-side. You can save the cartoonified image by clicking the "Save cartoon image" button. The saved image will be stored in the same directory as the original image with the name `cartoonified_Image`.

### Explanation of the Algorithms Used

The cartoonify project uses several image processing techniques to convert a regular image into a cartoon-like image. Initially, the script reads and converts the image to grayscale. A median blur is applied to smoothen the grayscale image, which is followed by adaptive thresholding to detect edges. The edges are used as a mask to retain the cartoon-like outlines in the final image. Concurrently, a bilateral filter is applied to the original image to smooth colors while preserving edges. The final cartoon image is created by combining the edge mask with the smoothed color image using a bitwise AND operation. This combination of edge detection, smoothing, and masking effectively transforms the original image into a cartoon representation.
