### How to Use and Run the Project Files and Codes

To run the age detection project, you need two Python scripts: gad_live_webcam.py and gad_test_image.py. These scripts require the OpenCV library and the pre-trained models for face, age, and gender detection. Ensure you have the following files in your working directory: opencv_face_detector.pbtxt, opencv_face_detector_uint8.pb, age_deploy.prototxt, age_net.caffemodel, gender_deploy.prototxt, and gender_net.caffemodel. Install OpenCV by running pip install opencv-python. To run the webcam-based script, execute python gad_live_webcam.py. For image-based detection, place your image in the directory, modify the image_path variable in gad_test_image.py to your image's filename, and run python gad_test_image.py. The script will process the image and save the result as result_image.jpg.

### Explanation of the Algorithms Used

The age detection project leverages deep learning models for face, age, and gender detection using OpenCV's DNN module. The highlightFace function detects faces in the input image using a pre-trained face detection model (opencv_face_detector). It processes the image to create a blob, which is then passed through the network to identify face regions with a confidence score above the threshold. Detected faces are highlighted with bounding boxes. For each detected face, the region is further analyzed to predict age and gender. The age and gender detection models (age_net and gender_net) are based on the Caffe framework. These models also process the face region to create a blob, which is then input to the respective networks. The output layer provides the predicted age and gender, which are annotated on the image.
