### How to Use and Run the Project Files and Codes

To run the face recognition project, follow these steps: First, execute `face_taker.py` to capture and save images of the user's face. This script uses the webcam to take 30 samples of the user's face and saves them in the 'images' directory. Ensure you have the `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` file in the same directory. Next, run `face_train.py` to train the LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) face recognizer with the captured images. This script processes the saved images, detects faces, and trains the model, saving the trained model as `trainer.yml`. Finally, execute `facy_recognizer.py` to recognize faces in real-time using the webcam. This script loads the trained model, captures frames from the webcam, detects faces, and recognizes them, displaying the recognized name and confidence level on the screen.

### Explanation of the Algorithms Used

The face recognition project involves three main stages: face capturing, training, and recognition. The `face_taker.py` script uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier to detect faces in real-time and save grayscale images of detected faces. The `face_train.py` script utilizes the LBPH algorithm to train a face recognizer. LBPH is an effective method for face recognition that labels pixels in a neighborhood, producing a histogram that represents the features of the face. The trained model is saved as `trainer.yml`. In `facy_recognizer.py`, the trained LBPH recognizer is used to identify faces in real-time video streams. It detects faces using Haar Cascades, extracts features using the LBPH method, and compares these features against the trained model to recognize the face, displaying the name and confidence level on the video feed. This combination of face detection and recognition provides a robust solution for identifying individuals in real-time applications.
