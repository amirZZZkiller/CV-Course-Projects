### How to Use and Run the Project Files and Codes

The `qrcode.py` script provides a solution for detecting and decoding QR codes from both images and live video streams using OpenCV. To detect and decode QR codes from an image, ensure you have a file named `qrcode.png` in the same directory as the script. Running the script will read the image, detect QR codes, and decode the information contained within them. The decoded information, along with the coordinates of the QR code corners, will be printed to the console. The script will then draw a green polygon around each detected QR code and annotate the image with the decoded information, saving the resulting image to the directory as `qrcode_opencv.jpg`.

For live video stream QR code detection, the script captures video from the default camera (camera index 0). It continuously reads frames, detects and decodes QR codes, and displays the results in a window. Each detected QR code is outlined with a green polygon, and the decoded information is displayed on the video feed. To exit the live video stream, press the 'q' key.

### Explanation of the Algorithms Used

The `qrcode.py` script uses the OpenCV library's QR code detection and decoding capabilities. The script first initializes the `QRCodeDetector` object, which is responsible for detecting and decoding QR codes. For image-based QR code detection, the script reads the image file, detects multiple QR codes using the `detectAndDecodeMulti` method, and retrieves the decoded information and corner points of the QR codes. The results are drawn on the image using `polylines` and `putText` functions. For live video stream detection, the script captures video frames, processes each frame to detect QR codes, and annotates the frames with the results. The detection algorithm scans the image or video frames for QR code patterns, decodes the data, and returns the information. This approach allows for real-time QR code detection and decoding in various applications, such as scanning QR codes from printed materials or digital displays.
