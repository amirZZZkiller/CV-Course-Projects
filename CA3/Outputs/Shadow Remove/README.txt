### How to Use and Run the Shadow Removal Script

The `shadow_removal.py` script provides functionality to remove shadows from images using advanced image processing techniques. To utilize this script effectively, follow these steps:

Firstly, ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed, including OpenCV (`cv2`), NumPy (`np`), scikit-image (`skimage`), and Matplotlib (`plt`), as these are essential for executing the script.

Next, place your target image file (`test_image.jpg` in this example) in the same directory as the `shadow_removal.py` script or specify the correct path to your image within the script.

Adjust the parameters within the script based on your specific requirements:
- **ab_threshold**: Adjust this threshold to control the sensitivity of shadow detection. Higher values may include more areas as shadows.
- **lab_adjustment**: Set this boolean parameter to `True` if you want to perform color adjustment in LAB color space. This adjustment can help in restoring colors affected by shadows.
- **region_adjustment_kernel_size**: This parameter determines the size of the kernel used in morphological operations to adjust the shadow regions.
- **shadow_dilation_kernel_size**: Adjust the kernel size for dilation, which expands the detected shadow regions for better correction.
- **shadow_dilation_iteration**: Set the number of iterations for dilation to refine the shadow region.
- **shadow_size_threshold**: Specify the minimum size (in pixels) for detected shadow regions to be considered for correction.
- **verbose**: Set to `True` if you want to visualize the intermediate steps and results during the shadow removal process.

Run the script (`shadow_removal.py`) in your Python environment. Upon execution, the script reads the specified image, detects shadows using the configured parameters, and applies shadow removal techniques. It outputs three images:
1. **Original Image**: Displays the input image before any processing.
2. **Shadow Regions**: Visualizes the detected shadow regions with a mask overlay.
3. **Corrected Image**: Shows the final image with shadows removed and colors adjusted if `lab_adjustment` is enabled.

Optionally, if you set the `save` parameter to `True` within the `process_image_file` function, the corrected image will be saved in the same directory with a filename appended with "_shadowClear".

### Explanation of Shadow Removal Algorithms

The `shadow_removal.py` script employs several algorithms to effectively remove shadows from images:
- **Mask Generation**: Utilizes LAB color space to generate a binary mask distinguishing shadowed areas from non-shadowed regions based on predefined thresholds.
- **Region Processing**: Iterates over connected components in the mask, identifying shadow regions by size and shape.
- **Color Adjustment**: Optionally adjusts colors in LAB or BGR color spaces to restore the original appearance of areas affected by shadows.
- **Visualization**: Provides visual feedback on intermediate steps, such as displaying shadow regions and the final corrected image using Matplotlib.

By adjusting the script's parameters and understanding its underlying algorithms, users can achieve robust shadow removal from images, enhancing the overall quality and clarity of the visual content. This approach is suitable for various applications, including image editing, computer vision tasks, and improving image analysis accuracy.
